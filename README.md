The safe_web_app_quick_start by Maidsafe, with a couple of extra utilities added.

This app now saves the address of a randomly generated Mutable Data object in the app's own container, in order to return to it, assuming no other Mutable Data is already associated with the app and the user's account.

The app also adds the functionality to edit Mutable Data entries, as well as some user interface messages to show when changes are saved, and to prevent inadvertent loss of changes.
